My name is Raheem Chaudhry and I am currently a secpmd-year PhD student in Public Policy at the [Goldman School of Public Policy](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/phd-students/raheem-chaudhry) at UC Berkeley. In general, I am interested in exploring the economic outcomes of low-income children -- in particular, low-income children of color -- and the factors that contribute to or inhibit their success. More specifically, I am focused on how local policy creates segregation, how segregation affects the well-being of children, families, and communities, and how policy can ameliorate segregation or attenuate its effects.

I am passionate about racial justice and ensuring equal access to opportunity for all children. I aspire for my research to help uncover policy interventions that make progress on these fronts.

Prior to coming to UC Berkeley, I conducted research on a range of issues affecting low-income families at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/raheem-chaudhry).
