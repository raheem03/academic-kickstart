I am currently a third-year PhD student in Public Policy at the [Goldman School of Public Policy](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/phd-students/raheem-chaudhry) at UC Berkeley. I am interested in how we can increase access to opportunity for children from disadvantaged or historically marginalized backgrounds.

My current work, broadly, explores how public policy and political institutions can work to perpetuate or attenuate economic and racial inequality. This works sits at the intersection of local public finance, political economy, and housing policy.

Prior to coming to UC Berkeley, I conducted research on a range of issues affecting low-income families at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/raheem-chaudhry).
